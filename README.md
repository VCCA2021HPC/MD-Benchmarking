# MD-Benchmarking
Scaling analysis and benchmarking of all-atom MD simulation on Bridges2
The analysis are performed for GPU (using MPI and CUDA), CPU (with MPI), and CPU (with thread_MPI).
The summary of the benchmarking analysis for each catagory is in the file 'benchmarks.txt' (eg: AA-LLC/CPU/test_np/benchmaks.txt)
